                    <p>When I waitressed in college I heard a chef say that even though he despised it, he felt it necessary to have a chicken dish on the menu. The kitchen staff made assumptions about the safe, boring soul ordering the chicken, and as a result, it was the most uninspired dish on the menu. I could hardly fake a smile when a customer ordered the chicken, knowing there were so many superior options—the scallops, the braised short ribs, the handcut pappardelle!</p>
